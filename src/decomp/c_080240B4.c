/* The map header is reached through a struct declared LOCALLY and cast onto the
 * `u8 *` symbol (the wave-34 W34-F rule): the ROM computes every plane address
 * as `(map + K) + idx`, which only a COMPONENT_REF preserves. Writing the cast
 * inline at all four sites rather than binding one `map` local is what makes
 * agbcc re-read gMapData after the `bl __divsi3`, exactly as the ROM
 * does -- a single binding would park the pointer in a callee-saved register
 * across the call instead.
 *
 * gUnknown_08499B0C appears TWICE in the literal pool under two spellings: as
 * `.LC2` (a -fforce-addr .rodata word, the ROM's 0x08090A24 == 0x08499B0C) for
 * the scan, and as a plain inline pool word for the final read. Both come out
 * of the one honest name; see include/unknown-globals.h. */

/* Near-twin of sub_080240B4: same scan of the 0xFFFF-terminated
 * gUnknown_08499B0C list against the map's +0x0A22 tile halfword, same
 * `i / 5 * 5`, same `(s16)n` return. Three differences -- it does not write
 * gUnknown_030033F8, it guards the store with `n <= 4`, and its table index
 * carries the +0xa base of the second table packed behind the terminator.
 *
 * THE `(u8)` CAST ON THE INDEX IS LOad-BEARING and is the whole difference
 * between 79.4% and a match. The ROM computes `(a3 >> 5) + 0xa` FIRST and adds
 * n to it (`lsr; add #0xa; add r0,r3,r0`). Written as plain arithmetic that
 * grouping cannot survive fold: `n + (a3 >> 5) + 0xa` associates to
 * `(n + (a3 >> 5)) + 0xa`, and `n + ((a3 >> 5) + 0xa)` is rewritten by fold's
 * `A + (B + C)` -> `(A + C) + B` rule into `(n + 0xa) + (a3 >> 5)`. Both are
 * the right value and the wrong instruction order. A cast to a narrower type
 * interposes a NOP_EXPR that fold will not associate through, so the grouping
 * is preserved -- and it is value-safe here, since `(a3 >> 5) + 0xa` is
 * 0xa..0x11 for any u8 a3. Binding the sub-expression to an `int` local
 * instead (probed) preserves the grouping too but schedules the shift up above
 * the map address computation, which is a different miss. */
