/* src/decomp/c_0803AA78.c's other twin, and the only structural difference is

 * passes &gUnknown_03004100 itself, this one passes the unk18 word of the
 * gUnknown_03001470 slot that sub_08015BD0 just found.
 *
 * The `lsls #0x18; asrs #8; lsrs #0x10` triple is ONE narrowing, not a mask
 * plus a shift: left 24, arithmetic right 8, logical right 16 leaves the
 * sign-extended byte zero-extended into 16 bits, i.e. `(u16)(s8)`. That is an
 * s16 LOCAL holding sub_08015BD0's s8 return and living across the
 * sub_08025BE0 call -- the wave-29 (W29-C) round trip -- which is why the use
 * re-signs it with `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` before the x0x60 index scaling. */
