/* Wave 51, W51-E.  Closes wave 48's park (38.5% / +4 bytes) with no change to
 * the shape it had already settled: the residual was entirely the loop FORM.
 * As a `do { } while (...)` LICM hoists three invariants into the preheader --
 * `add rN,sp,#4`, the pooled 0x270F, and gUnknown_03003340's base -- which
 * costs one extra callee-saved register (r9) and, because the hoisted address
 * is re-emitted as an ordinary inline-pool reloc, DELETES gUnknown_03003340's
 * -fforce-addr .rodata word (0x0816D9CC).  Written as a goto loop there is no
 * NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG, LICM never runs, and all three come back at once.
 * This is wave 49's `sub_080309AC` / `sub_08030B00` finding applied to the
 * measurement the -fforce-addr chapter itself was still citing as open. */
