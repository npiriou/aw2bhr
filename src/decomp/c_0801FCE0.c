/* Paints a 3-wide vertical bar of a3 into the gUnknown_03003340 row-pointer
 * screen, from row a2 down to the bottom edge (the +0x02 height of the
 * gMapData map), starting at column a1.
 *
 * The row index IS the second parameter, walked in place: the `lsls #16;
 * lsrs #16` at the loop bottom is the u16 wrap of `a2++` and the guard/latch
 * pair is UNSIGNED (`bhs`/`blo`) because both operands are known
 * zero-extended halfwords. The prototype in include/unknown-functions.h stays
 * `(int, int, int)` -- the narrowing is done by three local copies at the top
 * of the body, which puts the `lsls/lsrs` triple in the prologue exactly as
 * declared narrow parameters would but WITHOUT forcing the truncation onto
 * c_0803E9F8.c's already-matched call site. Probed both spellings this wave;
 * the bodies are identical.
 *
 * The height bound is re-read from memory every iteration (c_0801F838's rule);
 * only the row address `&gUnknown_03003340[y]` is hoisted out of the inner
 * loop, which is the compiler's own CSE and not a source local. */

 * Parameters are narrowed by three local copies rather than being declared
 * u16/u16/u8, which produces the same prologue `lsls/lsrs` triple while

 * The two bounds are the map's width (+0x00) and height (+0x02), re-read from

 * hoists `&gUnknown_03003340[a2]` as an invariant and the second's
 * `adds r1, #4` is strength_reduce turning the `gUnknown_03003340[i]`
 * subscript into a post-increment giv, with the giv's `ldr r1,=` init landing
 * in the preheader after the zero-trip guard. Writing either as an explicit
 * walking pointer emits the `ldr` ahead of the guard and reorders the pool. */
