/* The two sub_0802BD54 arguments carry an explicit (u16) cast and the two
 * sub_0801BD00 ones do not -- the ROM truncates the first pair with
 * `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` (fused into the `0x8c << 0xf` add on the first,
 * which reuses the a1 << 16 still live in r0) and leaves the second pair
 * alone. sub_0802BD54's first parameter is declared int; the cast reproduces
 * the ROM without retyping a prototype other callers share. Dropping it also
 * costs the register assignment: a1 moves to r5 and gUnknown_0849A3B8 to r4,
 * the reverse of the ROM. */
