 * (`*(u16 *)(gMapData + 0x417A + y * 2)`) fold's `associate` path
 * pulls the constant outward and emits `(map + y * 2) + 0x417A` instead --
 * measured on this function, where it also cost the two registers the ROM
 * spends holding 0x417A and 0x1432 across the inner loop. Same finding as the
 * wave-34 note in include/unknown-globals.h, reached independently here.
 *
 * The member set is written to match sub_0803D2F8's copy of this declaration
 * exactly, so the two survive being promoted into one translation unit. */
