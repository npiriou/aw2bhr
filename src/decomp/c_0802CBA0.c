 *
 * `movs r2,#0; ldrsh r0,[r1,r2]` and `movs r2,#2; ldrsh r1,[r1,r2]` is the
 * s16-OBJECT tell, and it is why union Unk802C57CBuf gained a signed view: the
 * u16 `.pos` spelling emits `ldrh` and lets sub_080422A8's declared s16
 * parameters do the sign extension, and an (s16) cast on a u16 member emits
 * `ldrh; lsls #16; asrs #16`. Only a genuinely s16 member produces the register-
 * offset `ldrsh` here (ldrsh has no immediate-offset form, hence the scratch).
 *
 * `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18; cmp #1` is sub_080422A8's bool8 return kept for a
 * compare against a non-zero constant. The THEN arm is `return FALSE` and it
 * sits after the pool, so this is the sub_0802C5F0 spelling.
