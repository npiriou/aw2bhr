/* Draws one 8-wide sprite per army slot, 24 pixels apart down the column at
 * x = 0x10. Two readings are not free:
 *   - The `+ 0x56` off a 0x3c-stride record is `[i + 1]`, not a member at 0x56:
 *     0x56 - 0x3c = 0x1a, so this is gArmyRecords[i + 1].unk1a (the same
 *     u8 palette/army key every other reader of that field uses) and slot 0 is
 *     skipped, which is why the loop counter starts at 0 while the record index
 *     does not.
 *   - The bound is re-evaluated every iteration, which is what puts the whole
 *     `?:` in the `for` condition rather than in a local: the ROM re-loads
 *     gUnknown_03003FC0 and re-runs the call at the loop bottom on each trip.
 *     Both arms return u8, hence the `lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` before the
 *     signed `cmp r4, r0; blt`.
 * `ldr r5, .LC` held across the loop is agbcc's -fforce-addr pool word for
 * &gUnknown_03003FC0 -- the ROM word the splitter calls gUnknown_081D93F8,
 * which dereferences to 0x03003FC0. */
