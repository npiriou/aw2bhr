/* Sets up the unit records the 0x08031 screen edits: publishes
 * &gUnitRecords[1] as gUnknown_030040D8, redraws the 0xc-wide window, and
 * writes two fields on element 1 and two on element 2.
 *
 * THE +0x18 / +0x1C STORES ARE ELEMENT 2, NOT MEMBERS 0x18 AND 0x1C. struct
 * UnitRecord is 0x0c bytes, so 0x18 == 2 * 0x0c is that element's unk00 and
 * 0x1c its unk04_0 -- the `u16 unk04_0:7` bitfield already declared there,
 * which is exactly what the `AND ~0x7f; OR 0x64` store is. agbcc synthesises
 * 0xFFFFFF80 as `subs r0,#0x81` off the `movs r0,#1` the previous statement
 * left live, which is why the mask does not look like one. Both displacements
 * fit `strb`'s imm5, so no address arithmetic appears and the element indices
 * are invisible unless you know the 0x0c stride.
 *
 * THE ARRAY BASE IS BOUND TO A LOCAL. Naming gUnitRecords at each of its
 * three uses reloads the pointer twice more and puts a fourth word in the
 * literal pool; the ROM materialises it once into r4 and keeps it. By contrast
 * gUnknown_030040D8 IS reloaded for each of its two stores, so that one is
 * named directly -- the two spellings sit side by side in this function. */
