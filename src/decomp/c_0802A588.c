 * staged. sub_0803FECC's whole body is `adds r3,r2,#0; movs r2,#0;
 * bl sub_0803FF48`, i.e. it forwards r2 into sub_0803FF48's `ProcPtr` parent
 * slot -- so this proc passes itself as the parent, and nothing else explains
 * the copy.
 *
 * The `lsls/adds` cascade ending in `rsbs; asrs #2` is agbcc's division by 12
 * for a pointer difference; write it as `unit - gUnitRecords` and it falls
 * out. That difference is also what proves the +0x4c member's type. */
