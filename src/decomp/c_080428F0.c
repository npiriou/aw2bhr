/* gUnknown_08091360 is NOT a global: it is a `-fforce-addr` address-constant
 * word inside the documented 0x08091350-0x0809138C pool block, and it holds
 * &gUnknown_030040D8. Naming the global directly is the honest spelling and
 * lets the build place the pool word.
 *
 * Both sums load their ROM table entry BEFORE the gUnknown_03003100 half, so
 * the cursor position is the FIRST addend in the source -- writing the table
 * first reverses both `ldrb` pairs and costs gUnknown_03003100 its register
 * priority, since the pool `ldr`s come out in first-reference order.
 *
 * gUnknown_0849FFF8 is s16 and gUnknown_03003100's members are s16, yet every
 * read here is `ldrb`: the sum is stored with `strb`, so combine narrows both
 * loads. The byte access is not evidence of a byte type. */
