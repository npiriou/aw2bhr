 * gUnknown_08091388 is NOT a global -- baserom.gba holds 0x08499598 there, so
 * it is agbcc's `-fforce-addr` word for &gArmyRecords and the double
 * `ldr` is that indirection, not a pointer-to-pointer in the source.
 *
 * sub_08044280 and sub_080442AC are declared `int` but both results are tested
 * as BYTES (`lsls r0,#0x18; cmp r0,#0`), hence the casts. Their own bodies are
 * still asm, so the declarations are left alone rather than retyped. */
