/* MATCHED byte-for-byte (wave 43, W43-E).

 * NEEDS ITS .rodata POOL WORD PLACED: "rodata": ["0x08090EFC"]. That ROM word
 * holds 0x08499598, i.e. &gArmyRecords, so it is agbcc's own -fforce-addr
 * address constant and not a global. The honest `gArmyRecords[i]`
 * subscript emits the full three-level chain (`ldr rA,=<pool>; ldr rB,[rA];
 * ldr rC,[rB]`) by itself -- see the note above the declaration in
 * include/unknown-globals.h. trymatch reports only `relocs: name different
 * symbols that resolve to the same address`.
 *
 * The else arm's spelling is load-bearing and cost this function its one miss.
 * The ROM has ONE `movs r0,#0` block, at the end of the `unk01 == 3` path and
 * before the literal pool, which the sub_0803861C path reaches by branching
 * BACKWARDS into it (`beq _08038220`). Writing that arm as
 * `else if (sub_0803861C() == 0) return 0;` emits a `bne` to the return-1 tail
 * plus a SECOND copy of the return-0 block: +4 bytes, 89.1%. Writing it as
 * `if (...) return 1; return 0;` -- the early return spelled with the value
 * the fall-through does NOT use -- makes agbcc invert the branch, and the
 * duplicate block cross-jumps into the shared one. Same rule as sub_0803861C
 * in this block; see docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * `buf` is 5 bytes, not 4: the frame is `sub sp, #8` and agbcc rounds to the
 * 8-byte stack boundary, so a 4-byte array measures `sub sp, #4` and a 5..8
 * byte one measures 8. Five is the size every other per-army array in this
 * tree uses (slots 1..4 with element 0 unused), though only the 5..8 band is
 * proved.
 *
 * `buf[n] = i; n++;` and NOT `buf[n++] = i`: the post-increment form computes
 * the new n before the store, which lets agbcc clobber n's register with the
 * address and drops the `mov r5, sp` the ROM spends on keeping n live. Read
 * backwards, the ROM's extra callee-saved register IS the tell that the
 * increment is a separate statement.

/* Wave 43 (W43-F): return type changed from `int` to `bool8`. The note above
 * says nothing narrows the result; sub_08038240, the one caller, does -- it
 * truth-tests with `lsls r0,#0x18; cmp r0,#0`, and that shift only appears when
 * agbcc re-narrows a sub-word return. Byte-neutral here (both arms return a
 * literal), and re-verified as still MATCHED after the change.
 *
 * W43-E re-verified this independently and found the CONTROL PAIR that settles
 * it, inside that one caller: sub_08038240 calls sub_0803866C at 0x08038302 and
 * sub_080381C0 at 0x0803830E, sixteen bytes apart, and truth-tests both results
 * directly with no intervening local. The first is `cmp r0,#0` with NO shift
 * and is declared `int`; the second is `lsls r0,#0x18; cmp r0,#0`. Same
 * function, same compiler invocation, same use shape, differing only in the
 * declared return type -- so the shift here is the return width and nothing
 * else. */

 * sub_080176C0 block and reaches sub_0803BD60 by falling through, so the
 * sub_0803BD60 arm has to be the THEN arm in the source; spelling it the
 * natural way round emits the same instructions in the opposite order. Same
 * lever W43-E recorded on sub_080381C0 in this block.
 *
 * The two `break`s are real: `cmp #3; bhi` leaves the loop entirely rather than
 * skipping an iteration, and both arms jump to the same post-loop label. The
 * clear loop reads as descending (`subs; cmp #0; bge`) but is an ascending
 * `for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)` -- check_dbra_loop rewrote the counter, and the
 * pointer still walks forwards with `adds r0,#1`. */
