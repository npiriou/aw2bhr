 * unk66 is s16 and not the u16 sub_08040590 stores it as: every read here is
 * `ldrsh`, including the re-read after `unk66 += 8` -- the stored value is not
 * reused because the comparison needs it sign-extended. The `+= 8` itself is
 * `ldrh; adds; strh`, which is the same for either signedness.

 * unk54 is the pixel x sub_08040590 precomputed as `(unk2c << 4) + 8`, which is
 * why no `- 8` appears here and one does in sub_08040150 beside it. */
