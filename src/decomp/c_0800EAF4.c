/* Retile a 2x2 block when the cell at (x, y) is one of the two halfword ids
 * 0x86 / 0x87.  The plane arithmetic is c_0800164C.c's sub_080016D0 read: the
 * `rowOffset[y] + x` index off gMapData's +0x417A row table, doubled,
 * into the halfword plane at +0xA22.
 *
 * `subs #0x86; lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10; cmp #1; bhi` is gcc's range test for
 * `v == 0x86 || v == 0x87`, and the truncation pair is the u16 width of `v`,
 * not a cast this function performs.
 *
 * NEITHER `x + 1` NOR `y + 1` is a mutation or a named local here, and the
 * register allocation is the only thing that says so.  Writing `x++` between
 * the second and third call gives byte-identical instructions but swaps r4 and
 * r5 between x and y+1: the increment's pseudo is created at the statement and
 * outranks the CSE temp for y + 1, where in the ROM x holds r4 from the
 * prologue and y + 1 gets r5.  Spelling both as plain expressions at their use
 * sites leaves x's own parameter pseudo as the higher-priority allocno, which
 * is the ROM's assignment.  Same for a `n = y + 1;` statement, whether it sits
 * before or after the first call. */
