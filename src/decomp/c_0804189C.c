/* The tail sub_08041820 falls into when sub_0803DF54 finds no entry: it decays
 * the cell plane's own counter at (x, y) instead of an entry's unk04, then
 * starts the same 0x0849FE78 proc with unk4c NULL and the two coordinates
 * stored.
 *
 * Both plane addresses go through a struct laid over gMapData -- the
 * ROM computes `(map + 0x417A) + y * 2`, and only a COMPONENT_REF preserves
 * that association; the `u16 *` cast reassociates it to `(map + y * 2) +
 * 0x417A`. Same spelling that closed sub_08040790 and sub_08040200.
 *
 * gMapData and gUnknown_020288B4 are both named HONESTLY here even
 * though the ROM reaches them through agbcc's own -fforce-addr words at
 * 0x0809133C and 0x08091338 (whose ROM contents are 0x08499590 and 0x020288B4).
 * The build places this unit's .rodata pool word for each, which is the wave-18
 * rule. sub_08040790 names gUnknown_020288B4 with a clean pool word instead,
 * which is what proves it a real global rather than a pool artefact.
 *
 * The cell value goes through an `int` local, so the subtraction keeps the
 * CSEd `ldrsh` -- unlike the sibling sub_08041820, whose `ent->unk04 -= ...`
 * on a u8 lvalue makes shorten_binary_op narrow the same load to `ldrb`.
 * The address is expanded TWICE, once for the read and once for the store,
 * because the source names the cell expression twice with the diamond between
 * them; agbcc reloads both pointer levels rather than CSEing across the merge.
 *
 * `lim` must be bound AFTER the cell read: the ROM emits `ldrb r3,[r0]` before
 * `ldr r0,=gUnknown_030013D0`, and the binding is needed at all because
 * gUnknown_030013D0 is declared `u8 []`, so an inline `*(s16 *)(g + 0x14)`
 * folds the offset into the relocation and loses the clean pool word. */
