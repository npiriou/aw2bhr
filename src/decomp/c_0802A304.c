/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

/* A callback handed to sub_0802A38C beside sub_0802A2E4, so its parameter is
 * the same object: a struct UnitRecord unit record. It is NOT spelled that
 * way here on purpose. The loop reads the bytes at +7 and +8 through a
 * VARIABLE index, which the shared struct cannot express (they are the
 * separate scalars unk07/unk08 there), and widening them into a member array
 * would reshape a struct several promoted functions already read. The local
 * view below is byte-identical and touches nothing shared; the evidence that
 * unk07/unk08 are one cargo array of unit ids is recorded on the struct in
 * include/unknown-globals.h.
 *
 * The loop BOUND is the whole chain gUnitTypeData[p->unk00].unk14[0], and
 * it is re-evaluated at the bottom of every iteration -- the two calls kill
 * the load, so nothing is hoisted and nothing may be bound to a local.
 * `&gUnitTypeData[0].unk14` is the piece that IS common, and CSE parks it
 * in sb as `base + 0x14` rather than folding 0x14 into the ldr displacement.
 *
 * Counter is u8 (`lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18` renarrow) and both compares come
 * out unsigned (`blo`/`bhs`) because both sides are zero-extended bytes. */
