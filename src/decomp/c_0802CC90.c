 * Its neighbour sub_0802CCCC is the same predicate with the tests reordered and
 * comes out the other way round, so the two spellings are distinguishable and
 * this block contains one of each.
 *
 * gUnknown_030040D8->unk00 is the byte at offset 0, newly named: sub_080421D0
 * and sub_0804223C read the same byte off the same pointer to index
 * gUnitTypeData by 0x5c, so it is a record selector rather than a flag.
