/* "Is this unit on the current army's side?" -- the same unk2a comparison as

 * rather than supplied. `(a1 >> 6) + 1` is the usual 1-based army number, and
 * the `+ 1` never appears as an add: agbcc folds it into the displacement,
 * which is why the second `adds` is #0x66 = 0x3c + 0x2a. `lsls #0x10;
 * asrs #0x16` is the s16 sign-extension fused with the `>> 6`, so the shift is
 * ARITHMETIC and a1 is signed.
 *
 * `movs #0` and `movs #1` split across an unconditional `b` is the one shape
 * `return <cmp>;` cannot produce (docs/agbcc-codegen.md): a returned comparison
 * goes through do_store_flag and arrives with no branch at all. */
