/* A percentage, capped at 100: this army's unk18 measured against the summed

 * `((31x) * 4 + x) * 8` is 1000x -- write the multiply and let agbcc build the
 * shift chain. The `a * 0x3c` element offset is hoisted into r8 by LICM (it
 * sits AFTER the loop's own inits in the preheader) and is recomputed after
 * the loop because that live range has ended; neither is authored.
 *
 * `sum` is UNSIGNED and the Div result is assigned back INTO it. Both are
 * load-bearing: a fresh local puts the clamp in r0 and costs the
 * `adds r5, r0, #0`, and a signed `sum` turns the ROM's `bls` into `ble`. */
