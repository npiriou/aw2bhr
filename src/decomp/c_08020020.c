/* Grows the movement-range overlay by one cell: for every cell that is neither
 * negative nor already 1, any negative orthogonal neighbour that exists becomes
 * 1. Each neighbour's own sign is tested BEFORE its edge test -- that order is
 * the ROM's and it is what puts the `cmp rX,#0` after the `ldrsb`.
 *
 * gUnknown_03003340 is declared `u8 *[]` and every read here is `ldrsb`, so the
 * (s8 *) cast is on THIS function's access, not on the global: the declaration
 * is left alone per the shared-type rule. sub_0801F838, which fills the same
 * table, stores a u8 -- the two are consistent, the plane just carries a
 * negative "unreached" sentinel that only this reader looks at. */
