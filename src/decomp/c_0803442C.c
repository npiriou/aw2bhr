/* The nibble UNPACKER, inverse of src/decomp/c_08034400.c: each source byte's
 * high nibble goes to dst[i * 2] and its low nibble to dst[i * 2 + 1], with 0xf
 * mapped to 0xff in both.
 *
 * Two binding locals carry this, and both are readable off the register
 * allocation rather than guessed:
 *
 * `n` is ONE local reused for both nibbles, not two. The ROM computes both into
 * r2 -- `lsrs r2, r0, #4` and `movs r2, #0xf; ands r2, r0`. The second is forced
 * there (r0 holds the loaded byte and is the `and`'s other operand), but the
 * shift is not, and with two separate locals agbcc coalesces the shift into r0.
 * One local gives one pseudo whose live range spans both halves, so it takes a
 * single hard register and the shift is dragged to r2. That one instruction's
 * destination register was the last difference against an otherwise
 * byte-identical candidate.
 *
 * `j` sits BETWEEN the two `if`s, which is where the ROM's `lsls r3, r5, #1`
 * lands -- so the first store cannot be the one using it. The first store
 * reaches dst by a strength-reduced biv (r4, stepping 2) while `dst + j` is
 * recomputed in both arms of the second `if` off the preserved copy of dst in
 * r6. Writing both stores as dst[i*2] / dst[i*2+1] merges them into one biv
 * with #0 and #1 displacements, kills the index, and lets check_dbra_loop
 * reverse the loop -- 56 bytes against 64. See the check_dbra_loop section in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * src[i] is deliberately re-read rather than bound: the ROM has two `ldrb`. */
