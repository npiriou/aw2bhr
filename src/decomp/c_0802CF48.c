 *
 * gUnknown_08090C00 is NOT a global and must not be declared as one: the ROM
 * word at 0x08090C00 is 0x03003FC0, i.e. &gUnknown_03003FC0, and its immediate
 * neighbours at 0x08090BF8/BFC/C04 hold &gCurrentArmyIndex (twice) and
 * &gUnknown_030033E8 -- a `-fforce-addr` address-constant run. The honest
 * spelling is therefore just `gUnknown_03003FC0.unk2c`, and since wave 18 agbcc
 * parks its own copy of the address in this unit's `.rodata` and the split
 * places it. That reproduces the ROM's double indirection (`ldr r1, =word;
 * ldr r0, [r1]`) with no `*const` pointer declaration and no c_local
 * workaround.
 *
 * The compare is `bhi`/`bls`, an UNSIGNED ordering, which agrees with unk2c's
 * declared u8. The test is written `> 1` with the reset as the THEN arm: the
 * `<= 1` spelling emits `bhi` to the reset instead and puts the increment on
 * the fallthrough, which is the mirror of the ROM. The single `strb` after the
 * merge is agbcc cross-jumping the two stores, not a conditional expression.
