 * The 0x0805C block's own accept-a-cell predicate, the same skeleton as
 * sub_08058E88 with a different filter: the cell must be EMPTY (+0x12 is 0
 * rather than "mine or neutral"), its gUnknown_03003340 byte non-negative, and
 * its terrain code neither 0x0b nor 0x0d. Cells whose gUnknown_085767D5 entry
 * is set must additionally carry gUnknown_03004084 in the top three bits of the
 * same +0x1432 byte.
 *
 * WHAT CLOSED IT, after two waves at 98.7% (2 of 152 bytes, the AND's operand
 * tie):
 *
 *     original   movs r0,#0xe0 / ldr r1,=g / ands r0, r3 / ldrh / cmp r0, r1
 *     old draft  movs r0,#0xe0 / ldr r1,=g / ands r3, r0 / ldrh / cmp r3, r1
 *
 * THE FIX IS TO DELETE THE `u8 cell` LOCAL AND NAME `map->unk1432[idx]` TWICE.
 * The old draft recorded "`cell` is `u8`, not `int`. The ROM holds ONE QImode
 * pseudo live across both masks" as SETTLED. That was exactly backwards and it
 * is what cost this function two waves. Reading the member twice still emits
 * ONE `ldrb` -- CSE merges the loads -- but the two masks are then separate
 * tree nodes over a value with two REFERENCES, and reload's commutative `%`
 * swap on `*thumb_andsi3` ties the destination to the CONSTANT's register
 * instead of to the byte's. Binding the local makes the second mask the last
 * use of a one-reference pseudo, which flips the tie. Same instruction count,
 * same schedule; the binding is worth 2 bytes and nothing else.
 *
 * Corroborated independently in the same batch: sub_08059E3C has the identical
 * `& 0x1f` / `& 0xe0` pair on the same plane byte and shows the same flip --
 * naming the member twice gives `ands r0, r1` (the ROM), binding it to a `u8`
 * local gives `ands r1, r0`. Two functions, same lever, opposite of the note
 * that had been sitting here.
 *
 * The constant-first spelling `0xe0 & map->unk1432[idx]` is still required and
 * is unchanged from the 98.7% draft: agbcc emits a comparison's operand classes
 * in source order, so this schedules the pool `ldr` for gUnknown_03004084
 * between the `movs #0xe0` and the `ands`, which is the ROM's interleaving.
 *
 * ALSO RULED OUT this wave: `int cell` holding the raw byte with a second
 * narrow local for the 5-bit code -- the old draft's "first thing a next
 * attempt should try". It scores 96.1%, worse than the draft it replaced: the
 * SImode pseudo sinks the pool `ldr` below the `ands` as well as keeping the
 * wrong tie. */
