/* A TWELFTH list builder of the src/decomp/c_0805CA60.c family, sitting past
 * the 0x0805CA60-0x0805D1F0 run the note in include/unknown-globals.h covers.
 * Its .rodata address-constant pair is the ROM's gUnknown_0816DA38 /
 * gUnknown_0816DA3C, which hold 0x030046B0 and 0x030045F0 -- dereferenced
 * against baserom.gba, the same values as every other pair in that block, so
 * they are NOT globals and the DIRECT `gUnknown_030046B0 = gUnknown_030045F0`
 * is what the original source said. It loops, so it gets a pair, exactly as
 * that rule predicts.
 *
 * The three filters are NESTED ifs rather than one `&&` chain, and the ROM's
 * instruction order is what settles it. Written as a chain, fold_truthop
 * merges `!(unk01 & 1)` with `unk00 == 7` into a single `ldrh; and 0x1ff;
 * cmp #7` on the halfword at +0 -- two adjacent fields compared against
 * constants in one container. The ROM keeps them apart and re-uses the r3 it
 * already loaded for the `!= 0` test, which only the nested form produces.
 * c_0805CA60.c does not need this because its third filter reads a different
 * object. Binding unk00 to a local `u8` also splits them, but costs a hoisted
 * `movs #1` and a third high register -- 4 bytes and the wrong allocation. */
