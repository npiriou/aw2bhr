 * A `switch`, not an if/else chain -- the repeated `cmp r0,#0x48` with `beq`
 * then `bgt` is gcc's binary-search decision tree, exactly as in
 * c_08016A2C.c.  The four arms only assign the index and merge, so the index
 * is one variable and not four duplicated bodies.  The default falls straight
 * to the function's bare `bx lr`, which is a `return` in the default arm and
 * not a guard ahead of the switch: a guard would have to name the four ids
 * twice.
 *
 * The two constants are written differently by the ROM -- `movs r1,#0xff` for
 * unk17 and `movs r1,#1; rsbs r1,r1,#0` for unk1b -- so the original source
 * really does spell one 0xFF and the other -1.  That says nothing about the
 * declared signedness of either member; both stores are byte-identical under

/* A classification of the low five bits of a terrain byte into 0, 1 or 2.
 * agbcc emits a jump table because the twelve labels 6..17 are dense, and the
 * six "1" cases share one body, so the table holds the same target six times
 * -- the same construction as sub_08026C6C.
 *
 * The `movs r2, #0` sits AHEAD of the mask and the switch, and the three arms
 * converge on `adds r0, r2, #0`, so the result is ONE shared variable the
 * default arm falls through to -- not a `return` per arm, which would have
 * written r0 directly at each one.
 *
 * The lone `case 8` is written BEFORE the six-way group even though 8 sits
 * inside its value range, and the arm order is readable straight off the
 * bodies: gcc lays case bodies out in SOURCE order, so the arm that needs an
 * explicit `b` to the tail is the earlier one and the arm that falls through
 * is the later one.  The ROM has `movs r2,#2; b` first and `movs r2,#1`
 * falling through; writing the group first is 9 bytes different with the jump
 * table pointing the other way.
 *
 * The mask is this function's own: its caller sub_0800C840 masks too, but the
 * `movs r1,#0x1f; ands r1,r0` here is inside the callee, so the parameter is
 * unconstrained and `int`.
 *
 * A leaf: no `push`, and the epilogue is a bare `bx lr`. */
