/* sub_08018838's conditional twin: the army whose palette is repainted comes

 *
 * `subs r0, #1` is shared by both arms, so the `- 1` is applied ONCE to a
 * variable -- two separate calls would have folded `5 - 1` to `movs r0, #4`.
 *
 * The node's unk08 is declared `u16` and read `ldrsh` here, so it is cast at
 * the use, the same treatment it gets in c_08018DF8.c and c_08017C4C.c. Reading
 * it twice is what the ROM does: the else arm reloads it rather than keeping
 * the compare's value. */
