/* Loads one unit's sprite sheet and palette -- the sub_08041128 shape with a
 * switch. a1 packs an army in its top three bits and a class in its low five:
 * the class picks the ROM sheet, the army picks both sub_08024984's variant
 * index and the gArmyRecords record whose unk1a is the palette bank.
 *
 * THE FIELD EXTRACTIONS MUST BOTH BE MASKED. Wave 35 parked this at 82.2% with
 * `u8 sel = a1;` and a bare `sel >> 5`, and every unmasked spelling measured
 * this wave reproduces that miss:
 *   - ANY logical right shift of the narrowed value folds. agbcc merges
 *     `((a1 << 24) >> 24) >> 5` into `(a1 << 24) >> 29`, which leaves the
 *     SHIFTED-LEFT value live across the call instead of the narrowed one --
 *     `u8 sel`, `u32 sel = (u8)a1`, `(u32)sel >> 5`, `sel >>= 5`, a real `u8`
 *     PARAMETER, and narrowing in place into a1 itself all fold identically.
 *   - ANY signed right shift blocks the fold and gets the ROM's register
 *     allocation exactly, but spells the shift `asrs r4,r4,#5` where the ROM
 *     has `lsrs`. Two bytes, and no allocation lever reaches it.
 * A redundant mask on the SHIFT RESULT is what does both at once: `& 7` is a
 * no-op agbcc discards (it already knows the value fits in three bits), but it
 * breaks the shift-merge, and the remaining shift comes out logical. The
 * equivalent `(u8)sel >> 5` measures byte-identical. See docs/agbcc-codegen.md.
 *
 * Case-arm order is source order: case 8, `case 6: default:`, 14, 10, 11, 20.
 * `case 6` sharing the default arm is what makes the jump table run 6..20
 * (fifteen entries) rather than 8..20 -- the ROM's `subs r0,r5,#6; cmp r0,#0xe`.
 * `(u16)((a3 + 0x10) * 0x20)` is a MULTIPLY, as in the matched sub_08041128. */
