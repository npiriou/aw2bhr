 * `bl _call_via_r4` is ordinary agbcc output, not hand-written -- ARMv4T has no
 * `blx rN`, so every indirect THUMB call goes through a libgcc trampoline. The
 * register index is r4 because r0-r3 are all carrying arguments and the pointer
 * needs somewhere else to live.
 *
 * Five arguments to the callee and six to this function: the first is consumed
 * by the global, the rest are forwarded untouched, which is why none of them
 * costs an instruction. */
