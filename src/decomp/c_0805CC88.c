/* One of the thirteen list builders at 0x0805CA60-0x0805D1F0.  This one is the odd member: its
 * third filter is a RANGE on the unit id itself rather than a lookup in
 * gUnitTypeData, so it carries no pool word for that table and saves only
 * one high register.  `(u8)(unk00 - 0x10) <= 1` is the ROM's
 * `subs #0x10; lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18; cmp #1; bhi` -- a u8 truncation of the
 * difference and an UNSIGNED compare, which is exactly how a two-value id
 * range is written without a second branch.
 * Otherwise this is c_0805CA60.c exactly: the DIRECT spelling
 * `gUnknown_030046B0 = gUnknown_030045F0` by name, which is what the original
 * source said.  agbcc's -fforce-addr parks the two addresses in this unit's own
 * .rodata because both are live across the builder's loop; the two words are the
 * ROM's gUnknown_0816D9F8 / gUnknown_0816D9FC and the build now places them there
 * (tools/split_rodata.py).  Those two ROM words hold 0x030046B0 and 0x030045F0,
 * the same values as every other slot in the 0x0816D9E0-0x0816DA37 block (one
 * pair per builder, address order), so they are NOT globals of their own.
