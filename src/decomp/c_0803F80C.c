 * PROMOTION NOTE: the only reloc difference is agbcc's -fforce-addr copy of
 * &gArmyRecords at 0x08091304 (the ROM word there contains 0x08499598),
 * which gen_lds.py names gUnknown_08091304. Do NOT declare it -- write the
 * honest `gArmyRecords[i]`, which is what emits the ROM's three-level
 * `ldr rA,=<word>; ldr rA,[rA]; ldr rA,[rA]` chain. This entry needs
 *   "rodata": ["0x08091304"]
 * in data/promoted.json, then tools/split_rodata.py + tools/gen_lds.py.
 *
 * `pal` MUST be bound to a local. Naming gUnknown_080D3EE4 inline at all three
 * sites is size-exact at 50.0% with one extra instruction: LICM hoists the
 * symbol into the loop preheader as a pseudo of its own and emits
 * `adds r7, r4, #0` to get it there, and the loop's address add comes out
 * `adds r0, r0, r7` where the ROM has `adds r0, r7, r0`. One pseudo used three
 * times removes both.
 *
 * The `(u16)` casts are real source: ApplyPaletteExt's second parameter is
 * declared u32, so nothing narrows for free, and `(u16)(x * 0x20)` is the
 * spelling shorten_binary_op folds into the ROM's `lsls #0x15; lsrs #0x10`
 * pair -- `((x * 0x20) & 0xffff)` or a shift would each need three.

 * `adds r0, r5, r0; adds r0, #0x56; ldrb r0, [r0]` with the giv r5 stepping
 * 0x3c, and 0x56 is 0x3c + 0x1a -- the NEXT record's unk1a, reached through one
 * induction variable. struct ArmyRecord is 0x3c bytes, so an 0x56 member would
 * not fit it in the first place.
 *
 * sub_0801368C's second parameter is `u16`, and that is what makes the whole
 * offset expression a single giv: gcc strength-reduces the narrowing's own
 * `lsls #0x10` into the induction variable, so r4 carries the value pre-shifted
 * left 16 (init `((a2 + 0x11) << 21) + 0xc0000`, step 0x200000) and the use is a
 * bare `lsrs r1, r4, #0x10`. Do not try to author that -- write the arithmetic
 * and let loop.c produce it.
 *
 * sub_08026340() sits IN the loop condition, re-evaluated every iteration.
