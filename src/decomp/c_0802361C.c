/* Steps the gUnknown_030033E4 cursor cell one square in the direction the high
 * nibble of gpKeySt->unk02's low byte selects, using W33-D's gUnknown_08499C7C
 * (dx, dy) table, and drags the pixel-space gUnknown_030032C4 four times as far
 * -- the same pairing sub_0800105C uses. Each axis is bounds-checked against
 * the map header's own width/height and beeps only when the axis actually
 * moved, so a diagonal beeps twice.
 *
 * gUnknown_080909FC, gUnknown_08090A00 and gUnknown_08090A04 in the asm are
 * agbcc -fforce-addr .rodata words holding 0x08499590, 0x030033E4 and
 * 0x08499C7C, not objects; gUnknown_08090A14 in sub_08023860 is a second
 * private copy of the first of them. The map header is reached as a `u8 *`
 * with `*(u16 *)(p + k)` reads, which is the spelling c_0800119C.c and
 * c_08001158.c already use for gMapData.
 *
 * The guard is an early return and not a wrapping `if`: its branch goes
 * straight to the epilogue that both later bounds failures also reach. */
