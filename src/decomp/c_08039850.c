 * play the first whose terrain, whatever sub_08044374 counts, and (when it is
 * not the wildcard 0) army all match the proc's army. Returns whether one
 * fired -- sub_08039820 falls back to the random line on 0.
 *
 * The table pointer being NULL is a separate early-out from the run being
 * empty, and both land on the same `movs r0,#0`. The -1 sentinel is
 * materialised (`movs r1,#1; rsbs r1,r1,#0`) rather than compared as an
 * immediate because the member is s8 and sign-extends past `cmp`'s 8-bit
 * unsigned range; the loop then keeps the constant live in r7. */
