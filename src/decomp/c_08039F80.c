/* MATCHED wave 51 (W51-D). Redraws the unit-info panel: a stat pair, a label,
 * and -- only when the unit has more than one of whatever sub_08042D50 counts
 * -- a second row of the same three. Every row x is gUnknown_0849D89C->unk00
 * plus a fixed column, nudged 4 left when the value shown is a single digit.
 *
 * The nudges are CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, not k = 0; plus an if (worth 16
 * bytes): do_store_flag computes the operand first, presets 0, then
 * conditionally overwrites.
 *
 * THE FIX, after the draft sat at 97.6% with the second row record pointer and
 * nudge holding each other registers. Two facts, both about live-range length
 * rather than statement order (see docs/agbcc-codegen.md):
 *
 *   - k is an int holding 0xFC, sign-extended with an explicit (s8) at each
 *     use -- NOT an s8 local. The two spellings are byte-identical at the
 *     definition and at the use, and differ only in how many pseudos they
 *     create: a narrow local assignment is a truncating copy that combine
 *     propagates away, splitting k into one short-lived pseudo per row, while
 *     an int keeps ONE pseudo spanning both. The ROM holds the nudge in r3 in
 *     BOTH rows, which one pseudo can do and two cannot. That long live range
 *     is what wins r3 and pushes the record pointer down to r2.
 *   - p is declared with the others but assigned ONLY in the second row. The
 *     draft also assigned it in the prologue, making it the longest-lived
 *     pseudo in the function and handing it r3. CSE serves the prologue and the
 *     first row from the q load, exactly as the ROM does.
 *
 * Binding the second row record to a local r was in the draft as a claimed fix
 * and is the OPPOSITE: removing it is what put the pointer in r2. Allocation
 * order here is longest-live-range-first, and the first allocated gets r3
 * (ARM REG_ALLOC_ORDER is 3, 2, 1, 0).
