/* Repaints the cell (x, y) and its four orthogonal neighbours, skipping any
 * that falls outside the map. The offsets come from a pair of five-entry s16
 * direction tables -- gUnknown_0848897C = { 0, -1, 1, 0, 0 } (dx) and
 * gUnknown_08488986 = { 0, 0, 0, -1, 1 } (dy), both dereferenced in
 * baserom.gba -- so index 0 is the cell itself and 1..4 are left, right, up
 * and down.
 *
 * They are named as two separate arrays rather than one 2x5 table: the ROM
 * materialises dy through its own inline pool word instead of indexing off
 * dx's base register, which a `tbl[1][i]` spelling cannot produce.
 *
 * The word at 0x0808D8A0 is NOT a global -- it is agbcc's own -fforce-addr
 * .rodata address constant holding 0x0848897C, one slot before the
 * 0x0808D8A4/0x0808D8A8 pair c_08010B34.c documents for &gMapData.
 * The honest spelling below reproduces the two-level `ldr r7,=<word>` /
 * `ldr r0,[r7]` load and promotion must carry the rodata entry. */
