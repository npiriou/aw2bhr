/* Wave 52, W52-B.  MATCHED (hand to 95.0%, permuter closed the rest).
 *
 * TWO SPELLINGS THAT LOOK IDENTICAL AND ARE NOT, both measured here and both
 * written up in docs/agbcc-codegen.md:
 *  - `(&arr[w])->unk03[k]` matches; `arr[w].unk03[k]` costs 4 bytes (an r0/r1
 *    swap around the `ldrsb`).  Do NOT tidy this into the member form.
 *  - `arr` must be bound in its OWN statement AFTER `w` is read.  Written as
 *    `&gPropertyList[w]` in place, the pool `ldr` is scheduled between the
 *    pointer global's two loads instead of before them.
 *
 * gUnknown_03004788 is VOLATILE and this function is what proves it: the ROM
 * keeps its ADDRESS in r2 and issues a SECOND `ldr r1,[r2]` for the clamp,
 * where CSE otherwise folds the assignment to `adds r1,r0,#0`.  See that
 * symbol's comment in include/unknown-globals.h; sub_08061CF8, the only other
 * reader, was re-verified byte-exact after the change.
 *
 * The loop is a `goto` loop, as its sibling c_0805B778.c is: nothing is
 * LICM-hoisted into a preheader -- the 0x270F, the sp alias and
 * gMapData are all re-formed on every iteration.
 *
 * The cell lookup is c_08057F00.c's sub_08058144 idiom -- p, then t, then
 * rows, then idx, then cells -- keeping 0x417A and 0x193A in pool words.
