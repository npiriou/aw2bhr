/* Sets up the pan/zoom proc sub_0806AA80 just started: clears the top palette
 * row, records a start and an end position in 12-bit fixed point, derives the
 * per-frame step for each axis by dividing the span by the 0x33-frame duration,
 * and hands the proc to gUnknown_085815D0 (whose sub_0806A578 reads unk5a back
 * through its own +0x2c -- see src/decomp/c_0806A534.c).
 *
 * The divides are `__divsi3`, not Div, so they are the plain `/` operator.
 * unk5a is a genuine s16 OBJECT: both call sites reload it with the
 * `movs rI, #0; ldrsh r1, [r6, rI]` register-offset form rather than reusing
 * the 0x33 just stored.
 *
 * The clear loop is ASCENDING in the source even though the ROM counts r1 down
 * from 0xf and walks the pointer backwards from &gPal[0x14f]. The preheader is
 * what proves it: agbcc writes the source's own init FIRST, then LICM's hoists,
 * then strength_reduce's giv inits -- and here `movs r1, #0xf` lands THIRD,
 * after the hoisted `movs r2, #0` and after the `=gPal` load, so it was written
 * by check_dbra_loop and not by the source. Spelling the loop descending puts
 * `movs r1, #0xf` first and costs 6 bytes.
 *
 * The proc is reached through a CAST rather than a `struct ... *proc = a1;`
 * binding. The binding is an executable statement, so agbcc emits its
 * `adds r5, r0, #0` at the first statement of the body, AFTER the entry saves
 * of r1 and r2; the ROM saves all three in parameter order, which only happens
 * when r0 is used directly as a parameter. */
