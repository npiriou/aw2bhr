/* Copies up to four 0x20-byte HP/status digit tiles plus one 0x80-byte block
 * into OBJ VRAM for a unit's map sprite, then puts the sprite out through
 * sub_0801BD00 with one of two 5-entry pointer tables depending on whether
 * anything was drawn.
 *
 * Three source-level levers, none of which a straight transcription gets
 * right, and each one alone was the whole difference:
 *
 * (1) a4 is s16, NOT u16 with (s16) casts at the uses. The ROM materialises
 *     `a4 << 16` once (`lsls r4, r3, #0x10`) and derives BOTH the u16 third
 *     argument of sub_0802706C (`lsrs r2, r4, #0x10`) and every `(s16)a4`
 *     (`asrs`, six sites) from it. A u16 parameter hands the already
 *     zero-extended pseudo to the callee with no shift pair at all. Same for
 *     a1/a2: `(s16)a2 | 0x400` lets combine sink the extension past the OR
 *     (`orrs` then `lsls;asrs`), where the ROM has `lsls;asrs` then `orrs`
 *     -- an s16 parameter's extension is a promotion, not a sinkable cast.
 *
 * (2) Each arm binds three locals. `dst` is what puts the tile index AFTER
 *     the two bl's; without it the index statements are emitted ahead of
 *     them and have to survive the calls. `t`/`u` are what stop `fold`
 *     reassociating `a8 * 4 + ((a4 & 1) + 0x1dc)` into
 *     `(a8 * 4 + 0x1dc) + (a4 & 1)`: split_tree() pulls an INTEGER_CST out of
 *     either operand of a PLUS, so the only way to keep the ROM's grouping is
 *     for the inner sum to be opaque. Probed: one local for the a4 term alone
 *     keeps the grouping but emits it BEFORE `a8 * 4`; two give the order too.
 *
 * (3) The table choice is an if/else writing a `void *` local, not a `?:`
 *     inside the argument list. The ROM evaluates the whole table lookup --
 *     branch, index, `ldr` -- before touching a1, a2 or a8, which argument
 *     evaluation of a COND_EXPR in position 3 does not do. It also stops
 *     `(a4 - 1) * 4` reassociating into `a4 * 4 - 4` with the multiply
 *     hoisted above the branch. Worth 4 bytes and ~50 differing bytes.
 *
 * a3 and a8 are byte-neutral between u16 and s16 here (probed all four
 * combinations, all four match); s16 is written for uniformity with a1/a2/a4
 * and is NOT proven.
 *
 * gUnknown_0849A218 and gUnknown_0849A22C are two separate 5-entry tables,
 * not one array: the ROM holds 5 words at each, and 0x0849A240 is unrelated
 * data (0x40000001). The index is `a4 - 1`, so a4 runs 1..5.
