/* Scans the army's 0x40 unit records for a type-0x14 unit standing on a tile
 * whose gUnknown_03003340 entry is not -1, and writes that unit's cell column
 * and row back through the out-parameter as two halfwords. The prototype in
 * include/unknown-functions.h records the argument as the address of a 4-byte
 * (u16, u16) stack object shared with sub_080591E4, hence the local view here.
 *
 * `(s8)` on the u8 the row pointer yields really is a CAST and it really does
 * come out as `lsls #0x18; asrs #0x18`. That does NOT contradict wave 37's
 * finding that `ldrh; lsls; asrs` is not an `(s16)` cast: THUMB has no
 * immediate-offset `ldrsb`, so sign_extend (mem:QI) has nothing to fold into
 * here and the shift pair survives, where sign_extend (mem:HI) always folds to
 * `ldrsh`. Probed both ways -- the cast is the only spelling that produces it.
 *
 * The loop bound is bound to a LOCAL, and the store is what forces it. The
 * body writes through a pointer parameter, which sets loop.c's
 * unknown_address_altered and makes any global re-read variant; the ROM
 * nevertheless reads gUnknown_03003F2C exactly once and check_dbra_loop turns
 * the exit test into a countdown, which it only does on an invariant bound. The
 * sibling builders that re-read the global in the loop (src/decomp/c_0805CA60.c,
 * sub_0805D2A0) are the contrast case. */
