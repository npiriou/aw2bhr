 * The switch subject is read `ldrh; lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` -- an UNSIGNED
 * halfword load followed by a separate sign extension. No plain read of a
 * 16-bit object produces that: agbcc folds `sign_extend (mem:HI)` into
 * `movs rI,#0; ldrsh rD,[rB,rI]` whatever the declared signedness, and that
 * fold was probed directly on both an s16 global (gUnknown_03004780) and a u16
 * one (gCurrentArmyIndex), through an intermediate s16 local, through an
 * intermediate u16 local, through `(s16)(u16)`, through `& 0xffff` and through
 * `*(u16 *)&`. All six give `ldrsh`. Only a load agbcc's combiner may not touch
 * -- a volatile-qualified read -- leaves the two halves apart.
 *
 * That is a REPRODUCTION, not a claim that the object is volatile:
 * src/decomp/c_08034394.c's sub_080343D8 reads the same symbol with the
 * register-offset `ldrsh` that only a non-volatile s16 object gives, and it is
 * matched. The two readings cannot both come from one declaration, so the
 * original's two translation units declared gUnknown_03004780 differently. The
 * header keeps the s16 that has the stronger evidence and this file spells its
 * own view locally.
 *
 * Case bodies come out in source label order, so the ROM's body order
 * 0,1,2,3,5,4 is the order the arms are written in; case 4 is last and is the
 * only one without a trailing `b`.
