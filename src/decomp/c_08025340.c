 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md describes -- write it as a struct subscript.
 *
 * Binding the element to a local pointer is load-bearing: written inline as
 * `gUnitRecords[a1].unk01 |= 2` agbcc dereferences the pool word FIRST
 * (`ldr r0,[r0]`) and then computes the index, which is the reverse of the ROM.
 * With the local the index is computed while the pool word is still
 * undereferenced in r1, exactly as the ROM has it -- the same ordering effect
 * as the `p[X + C]` rule.
 *
 * `|= 2` and not a bitfield: the sibling sub_08025378 clears the same bit with
 * a BARE `movs r0,#0xfd`, and a 1-bit field's clear path emits the
 * negate-and-subtract chain instead. */
