 * answering whether the slot it landed on is EARLIER than the one it started
 * from -- i.e. whether the search wrapped past the end.
 *
 * gUnknown_08090A70 in the asm is NOT a global: the ROM word at 0x08090A70
 * holds 0x030033EC, so it is agbcc's own -fforce-addr address constant for
 * gCurrentArmyIndex.  Note this block also contains the OTHER case --
 * gUnknown_08090A84 is a genuine ROM byte table -- so the 0x0809xxxx prefix
 * decides nothing on its own; check baserom.gba per symbol.
 *
 * The global is re-read after the loop rather than reused because the
 * sub_080266DC call clobbers it, and the compare is `blo`, unsigned.
 * The `movs #0` / `movs #1` split across an unconditional `b` is the
 * if/else-return spelling, not a returned comparison. */
