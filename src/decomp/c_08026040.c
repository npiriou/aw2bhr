/* Deals the four army rosters out of the pristine bank in gUnknown_02022684:
 * one 0xC00-byte scratch block, 0x100 records copied into it, then one
 * sub_080260D0 per quarter (64 records each). The `1, 2, 3, 4` early-out is a
 * debug guard and is reproduced as written.
 *
 * The copy loop is a STRUCT ASSIGNMENT of the 0x0c-byte struct UnitRecord,
 * which is where the `ldm r0!, {r5,r6,r7}` / `stm r1!, {r5,r6,r7}` pair comes
 * from -- not a memcpy and not word-at-a-time. The element type is fixed by
 * sub_080260D0's promoted definition, which takes `struct UnitRecord *`.
 *
 * `subs r3,#1; cmp r3,#0; bge` at the bottom is check_dbra_loop's rewrite of
 * the ASCENDING `i < 0x100` counter, not a descending source loop. The four
 * arguments living in sl / [sp] / r8 / sb is plain register allocation; they
 * are four ordinary ints. */
