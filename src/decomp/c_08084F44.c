/* Slides the actor in over eight frames, unless gUnknown_03005940 says the
 * detail level is past 3, in which case it skips straight to the end state.
 * unk4c is the frame counter and unk4e the "still animating" flag; the two
 * halves of the animation are a kind-1 ease in over frames 0..3 and a kind-4
 * ease out over 4..7, which is why the second arm's `t` is `unk4c - 4`.
 *
 * `++p->unk4c == 8` really is a pre-increment on the s16 member and not a
 * separate read: the ROM does `ldrh; adds #1; strh` and only THEN sign-extends
 * for the compare, which is the increment's own value being reused rather than
 * a re-read.
 *
 * Same struct as sub_08083EE0 (+0x2c int, +0x4c s16, +0x4e s16, +0x66 s16) and
 * the same actor -- but, as there, that is field-set overlap and not a
 * discriminating use, so the type stays local to this file.
