/* Every fifth call (unk2b is a frame divider), advance to the next live army
 * whose gArmyRecords unk2a differs from the current one's, then walk that
 * army's 50 gUnitRecords slots from unk29 looking for the first live,
 * unflagged unit; decay its unk04_0 by `unk2d * 10` with a floor of 1, start
 * the 0x080452C0 popup for it and stop. unk29 is the resume cursor and wraps
 * to 1 with unk2a++ once it passes 0x32.
 *
 * `i` is u8 and `j` is u16 -- both read off the truncation on their own
 * increments, not off the u8 fields they are seeded from.
 *
 * The army search must be `while (1) { ...; i++; }` and NOT `for (i = ...;;
 * i++)`. Both are the same C, but the `for` puts the increment in its own
 * continue block ahead of the test and enters the loop with a `b` past it,
 * while the ROM's back edge is an unconditional `b` from an increment that
 * sits at the BOTTOM of the body. Costs no bytes, moves eight instructions.
 *
 * gUnknown_084995FE is a declared `s16 []` and the ROM reads it with a plain
 * `ldrh`, so the source has a `(u16)` cast on the entry -- without it agbcc
 * emits `movs r1,#0; ldrsh r0,[r0,r1]`, the same size and a different opcode.
 * Same finding as work/sub_080287D0.
 *
 * `proc->unk2a` is re-read from memory inside the second loop rather than
 * reusing `i`, and `proc->unk2d * 10` is NAMED TWICE so it becomes one CSE
 * feeding both arms of the floor test. The `& 0x7f` in the else arm is the
 * bitfield store's own truncation; the constant-1 arm needs none. */
