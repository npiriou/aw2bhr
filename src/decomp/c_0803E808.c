/* MATCHED (wave 49, W49-C), first attempt. 496/496 bytes.
 *
 * PROMOTION NOTE: the only reloc difference is agbcc's -fforce-addr copy of
 * &gMapData at 0x08091300 (the ROM word there contains 0x08499590),
 * which gen_lds.py names gUnknown_08091300. Do NOT declare it. This entry needs
 *   "rodata": ["0x08091300"]
 * in data/promoted.json, then tools/split_rodata.py + tools/gen_lds.py.
 *
 * Picks the highest-scoring occupied, visible cell on the map and appends it.
 * a3 is genuinely DEAD -- r2 is overwritten before it is ever read, and
 * sub_0803ED60's call site passes the record's s8 unk07 into it.
 *
 * Readouts worth keeping:
 *  - `best`/`score` are unsigned (`cmp r0,r4; bhi`), while bestX/bestY/bestT are
 *    `u16` locals: PROMOTE_MODE keeps them in SImode stack slots (word `str`),
 *    so the narrowing shows up as `lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10` AT EACH ASSIGNMENT
 *    and their reads at the sub_0803E560 call are free. Declaring them `int`
 *    loses three shift pairs; declaring them `u16` is what puts the pairs where
 *    the ROM has them.
 *  - `(u16)a5` at sub_0801FAC4's third argument is a real narrowing in the
 *    source: the two sub_0803E7C0/E7E4 calls above it use a5 un-narrowed, so it
 *    cannot be a parameter declaration.
 *  - sub_0803E7C0/sub_0803E7E4 return `void *` per their promoted definition,
 *    and here the results are ADDED to cell coordinates. The `(int)` casts are
 *    what that costs. This is evidence that struct Unk0849F688's two word
 *    members are integer deltas rather than pointers, but the existing type is
 *    byte-neutral at both sites and c_0803E7C0.c is already promoted, so it is
 *    recorded rather than changed.
