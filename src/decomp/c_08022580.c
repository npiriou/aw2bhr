 * gMapData.  Same for gUnknown_080909B0 (sub_080227A8),
 * gUnknown_08090978 (sub_08021D10) and gUnknown_0809099C; gUnknown_080909A0
 * holds 0x08499594.  Writing the honest name reproduces the whole chain:
 * `ldr rX,=.LC0; ldr rY,[rX]; ldr rZ,[rY]` is &word -> &global -> map pointer.
 *
 * +4 / +6 are the camera's pixel scroll, unwrapped to tile units by
 * `(s16)v >> 4`; the ldrh + lsls #0x10 + asrs #0x14 is that cast on a u16
 * member, not an s16 load. */
