/* A scripted 18-frame approach: the sprite's x steps 0x10 on seven scattered
 * frames of a jump-table switch, and frame 20 takes the last step, resets the
 * counter and unblocks the script instead of drawing.
 *
 * The switch is dense (unk2e 3..20) so agbcc emits a real jump table; the
 * unlisted frames share the table's default slot with the listed ones' `break`
 * target, which is why the seven step cases and the default arrive at the same
 * label. Case 20 `return`s -- it must skip BOTH the draw and the unk2e
 * increment, and a `break` would fall into them.
 *
 * THE `(u8)` ON sub_0801306C IS A CAST AT THE USE, NOT THE RETURN TYPE.
 * src/decomp/c_0801306C.c returns `int`; the bare `lsls #0x18` here is a
 * low-byte truth test written in the source. Reading it as a `u8` return
 * instead is byte-identical at this one call site and disagrees with the
 * promoted definition -- tools/proto_check.py catches that, try_match cannot.
 *
 * The camera origin is read TWICE, once for the on-screen test and once for
 * the draw, because they are separate expressions; only the address of
 * gMapData is held (in r7) across both. +0x29 and +0x2a each need a
 * runtime `adds` because ldrb's displacement stops at 31. */
