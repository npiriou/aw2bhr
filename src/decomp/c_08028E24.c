#include "proc.h"
/* The per-frame repeat callback of a sprite-burst proc: it steps a run of
 * `unk64` two-vector particles held at proc->unk4c and blits each one relative
 * to the map's scroll origin, until proc->unk66 reaches 8.
 *
 * proc->unk4c's elements are 8 bytes -- position at +0 / +2 and velocity at
 * +4 / +6, all four `ldrh` and `strh` with no sign extension anywhere, and the
 * ROM CSEs the element address into one register for all six accesses, which is
 * the plain `s[i].member` subscript.
 *
 * gMapData's +0x04 and +0x06 are s16 (`movs rI,#4 / ldrsh`, the
 * s16-object tell) and are subtracted from the particle's u16 position, so they
 * are a pixel scroll origin -- distinct from the +0x0C / +0x0E tile camera
 * recorded in include/unknown-globals.h. Reached through a locally-declared
 * struct cast per that file's standing rule for this symbol; the two loads are
 * re-issued every iteration because PutSprite may move the map.
 *
 * `i` is s16, hence the `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` at the top of each iteration
 * and the re-read of proc->unk64 through r5 at the bottom. The `mov r8, r2` is
 * LICM parking PutSprite's constant fifth argument, not source. */
