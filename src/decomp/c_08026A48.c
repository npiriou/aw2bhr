/* Assigns every army slot 1..4 its team colour, but only in game modes 1 and 2.
 *
 * The guard is a SWITCH, not an `if`. `cmp #2; bgt` / `cmp #1; blt` is gcc's
 * switch range check, which uses the raw case values; every `if` spelling was
 * tried and none of them reproduces it:
 *   - `x >= 1 && x <= 2` on the u8 member folds to `(x - 1) <=u 1` (one
 *     subtract and one compare);
 *   - splitting it into nested ifs or two early returns keeps two compares but
 *     goes UNSIGNED and rewrites `>= 1` as `!= 0` (`cmp #0; beq`);
 *   - assigning to an `int` local first restores the signed `bgt` but folds
 *     `>= 1` to `> 0` (`cmp #0; ble`).
 * Only the switch emits the literal `cmp #1; blt`, because expand_case does not
 * go through fold.
 *
 * gUnknown_08090A80 in the asm is NOT a global: the ROM word at 0x08090A80
 * holds 0x08499598, agbcc's -fforce-addr address constant for
 * gArmyRecords. (Contrast gUnknown_08090A84 in sub_08026B28, which IS a
 * real table -- the prefix decides nothing.)
 *
 * The 0x3c running offset is strength reduction of the element stride. */
