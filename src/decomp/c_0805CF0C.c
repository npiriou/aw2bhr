 * 188-byte siblings do.
 * Otherwise this is c_0805CA60.c exactly: the DIRECT spelling
 * `gUnknown_030046B0 = gUnknown_030045F0` by name, which is what the original
 * source said.  agbcc's -fforce-addr parks the two addresses in this unit's own
 * .rodata because both are live across the builder's loop; the two words are the
 * ROM's gUnknown_0816DA10 / gUnknown_0816DA14 and the build now places them there
 * (tools/split_rodata.py).  Those two ROM words hold 0x030046B0 and 0x030045F0,
 * the same values as every other slot in the 0x0816D9E0-0x0816DA37 block (one
 * pair per builder, address order), so they are NOT globals of their own.
