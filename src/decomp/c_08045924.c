/* "Does the current army have no unit left with a non-zero unk06_0?"  It walks
 * the army's 0x32 gUnitRecords slots from `(u16)gUnknown_084995FE[army] + 1`
 * and counts the live ones whose unk06_0 bitfield is set, returning TRUE only
 * when the count is zero.
 *
 * gUnknown_084995FE is declared `const s16 []` but is really u16 -- the ROM
 * reads it with a bare `ldrh`, so the source has the `(u16)` cast; without it
 * agbcc emits `movs r1,#0; ldrsh`.  Same finding as work/sub_08045090 and
 * work/sub_080287D0.
 *
 * The bound is NAMED TWICE (init and test) and CSEs to one `ldrh` chain; with no
 * call in the body everything is loop-invariant, so check_dbra_loop reverses the
 * ascending counter into `subs r3,#1 / bne` and strength_reduce turns the element
 * address into the r2 pointer giv.  The ascending source is what the bottom `bne`
 * reads out.
 *
 * `if (count == 0) return TRUE; return FALSE;` and not the inverse: agbcc
 * branches on the condition TRUE to the far arm and falls through to the
 * trailing return, so the constant the `beq` REACHES (1) is the `if` body. */
