/* Matched wave 43 (W43-J), after eight waves parked at 88.8% with every
 * register one lower than the ROM's. Two independent statement splits, both
 * needed, neither reachable by the permuter (it permutes existing allocnos):
 *  - `m = (j - 1) * 5;` on its own line keeps that addend emitted FIRST while
 *    moving the sum's accumulator onto `i * 17`, which is what the ROM does.
 *    W35 measured the whole-expression swap at 82.5% and concluded the written
 *    order was right -- the emission order was, the accumulator was not.
 *  - `p = (const u8 *)gUnknown_084A0090;` as its own statement AFTER both byte
 *    reads, then `p += ...`. W43-H had measured the same binding BEFORE the
 *    reads (pool ldr moves to the top) and inlined (loaded late); this is the
 *    third position and the one that wins the base callee-saved r4.
 * See the W43-J chapter in docs/agbcc-codegen.md. */
