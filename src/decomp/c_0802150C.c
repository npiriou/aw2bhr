 * is why each takes two `strh` off one pool word rather than two pool words.

 * TWO zeros are materialised: r4 serves every halfword and word store, r5 only
 * the `strb` into the u8 gUnknown_030030F8 at the end. agbcc keeps a separate
 * QImode copy of the constant, so the second `movs` is not a spare statement.
 * The 1 stored into gUnknown_03003F3C is reused for gUnknown_03004080. */
