 * one `&&` only in spelling -- both jump to the same exit and neither has a
 * body, so this is the short-circuit shape either way.
 *
 * The +0x4c member is a `struct UnitRecord *` on sub_0802A588's evidence, not
 * a guess: that handler reads the slot back, subtracts gUnitRecords from
 * it and divides the difference by 12 to recover the unit index. The proc
 * record itself is not otherwise modelled, so its struct stays local to the
