/* Spawns a gUnknown_0849BDE0 sprite at the cell (x, y) if that cell is on
 * screen, stashes the cell in the new gUnknown_03001470 slot's unk1e/unk20,
 * positions it relative to the camera, and rewrites two fields of the slot's
 * OBJ attributes.
 *
 * BOTH BLOCKERS RECORDED BY THE EARLIER PARKED DRAFT WERE WRONG, and the
 * corrections are the useful part of this function:
 *
 * 1. sub_08015438's fourth parameter does NOT need retyping. The old note
 *    argued the `void *` in include/unknown-functions.h was wrong because
 *    this caller passes a sign-extended s16 VALUE, and that fixing it meant
 *    editing five promoted files. It does not: `(void *)(int)a3` casts
 *    through `int` first, so there is no "pointer from integer of different
 *    size" warning, and it emits exactly the ROM's `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10`.
 *    The prototype is left alone.
 *
 * 2. The OBJ-attribute tail needs no store back, and struct UnkVec by value
 *    is right. The old note said the bitfield spelling writes the modified
 *    word to the stack local first while the ROM has no `str`. The answer was
 *    already in src/decomp/c_0803B2BC.c and c_08027A50.c, both matched and
 *    both doing this exact triple: when the whole edit is ONE expression
 *    assigned to `v.unk04`, agbcc forwards it into the by-value argument and
 *    emits no store. Two statements would have made it store.
 *
 * The three parameters are s16, read forwards from PROMOTE_MODE: each is
 * zero-extended once at entry and sign-extended again at every arithmetic
 * use, while the unk1e/unk20 stores use the RAW zero-extended copies -- which
 * is exactly `strh` of an s16 parameter.
 *
 * The X bound is ONE unsigned compare (`cmp #0xef; bhi`) and the Y bound is
 * TWO signed ones. That asymmetry is the source's: fold merges
 * `a < 0 || a > N` into an unsigned `> N` inside one expression but not
 * across two separate `if` statements.
 *
 * sub_080155C0's two arguments are computed in HImode -- `ldrh` on the camera
 * origin despite unk04/unk06 being s16, then one `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10` --
 * because that callee's parameters are s16, exactly as
 * src/decomp/c_08035B80.c documents for the same call. The bound tests above
 * read the SAME two members with `ldrsh`, because there the subtraction is
 * SImode. One declaration serves both sites.
 *
 * `id` is `s16`, and that is 4 bytes rather than a preference: it is what
 * puts the `ldr =gUnknown_03001470` BETWEEN the `lsls #0x18` and the
 * `asrs #0x18` of sub_08015438's s8 return re-narrow. With `s8 id` the pool
 * load lands ahead of both shifts and with `int id` behind both; only s16
 * splits the pair the way the ROM does. Found by decomp-permuter from a
 * 98.0% hand draft -- an order-only residual, which is precisely its case.
