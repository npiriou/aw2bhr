 *
 * This function is what corrected sub_08019940's prototype from `(int, int)` to
 * `(u8, u8)`. The ROM reads the u16 gCurrentArmyIndex with a bare `ldrb`, which
 * is the byte load only a u8 parameter produces out of a halfword global; the
 * callee's own prologue (`lsls r0,#0x18; lsrs r0,#0x18` twice) says the same
 * thing directly. The old declaration survived because every other promoted
 * caller passes literal constants.
