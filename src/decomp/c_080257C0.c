/* The unit-id form of sub_080255F4's "is this unit boxed in?" test, and NOT a
 * sibling of it -- the callee sets are disjoint and only the four-neighbour
 * tail is shared (family F061's shape, see src/decomp/c_0800B5C0.c, with a u16
 * accumulator).
 *
 * Three things here are not free, and all three are register-allocation facts
 * rather than semantics:
 *
 * 1. `x` and `y` are `s16` LOCALS, not `int`. Both spellings emit the identical
 *    `ldrb` pair and the identical signed `cmp; ble`, because the values are
 *    provably 0..255 either way. The difference is that the s16 spelling puts
 *    `x` in r8 and shuffles it into r4 at the first use, which is what the ROM
 *    does; with `int` the pair lands in r5/r4 and no high register is pushed.
 *
 * 2. sub_08025744's parameters are `int`. This function is the only evidence
 *    for that width and it is an ORDERING readout, not a narrowing one: every
 *    argument here is `ldrb`-derived so an s16 conversion would be elided and
 *    invisible. With `int` parameters the ROM's `subs r1, r5, #1; adds r0, r4,
 *    #0` order falls out on the two calls whose SECOND argument carries the
 *    arithmetic; with `s16` the two come out in argument-number order instead.
 *
 * 3. The whole map lookup is sequenced INSIDE the second argument with commas.
 *    The ROM evaluates sub_08026FD0's first argument -- including the `ldrsh`,
 *    not just its address -- before the map base is even loaded, and no
 *    statement form reaches that: written as statements ahead of the call the
 *    map goes first, and binding the first argument to a local of any width
 *    leaves the address in ip and lets CSE sink the `ldrsh` down to the call
 *    (the load has one use and nothing writes memory in between). The commas
 *    are almost certainly a macro in the original; what matters is that they
 *    are the only spelling found that emits the LOAD where the ROM has it. The
 *    map itself still needs its own locals -- see src/decomp/c_0800F564.c for
 *    why `rows` and `t` cannot be folded away. */
