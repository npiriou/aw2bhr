/* Wave 52, W52-B.  MATCHED.
 *
 * DO NOT DELETE `u->unk03 += 0;`.  It is a dead store and it is LOAD-BEARING.
 * See the wave-52 chapter in docs/agbcc-codegen.md: without it agbcc hoists
 * both gUnitRecords and the gUnknown_03003F2C bound out of the loop,
 * check_dbra_loop reverses the loop into a countdown, and the function comes
 * out 4 bytes short.  prescan_loop records the store, invariant_p then refuses
 * every MEM, and the store itself is deleted again before output -- so the
 * barrier costs zero bytes.  The out-pointer's type is NOT the lever: tried as
 * `struct Unk5A514Cell *` (48.1%, -4) and as the plain `u8 *` below (52.9%,
 * size-exact); neither blocks the hoist.
 *
 * Consumes the same {u8 x; u8 y; s16 v;} 4-byte record c_0805A514.c produces
 * and c_0805A744.c walks, terminated with v == 0xFFFF, and returns how many it
 * wrote as a gUnknown_03003F20-relative element count.  `new_var` is needed:
 * storing 0xFFFF directly costs an extra `adds r0,r1,#0`.
