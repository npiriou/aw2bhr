 * The `x * 5, * 17, * 257, * 65537` shift-add chain followed by `rsbs` is ONE
 * operation: agbcc's exact division for a pointer subtraction whose element
 * size is 0x0c. `-0x55555555` is `0xAAAAAAAB`, the modular inverse of 3, and
 * the remaining `>> 2` for the factor of 4 is folded into the source's own
 * `>> 6` to give the `lsls #8; lsrs #0x10` pair -- which is that `>> 8` and the
 * u16 conversion of the third argument fused. So the whole thing is
 * `(p - gUnitRecords) >> 6`, the record index divided by the 64-entry
 * army group that unknown-globals.h documents.
 *
 * The cast is the struct Unk030040D8 / struct UnitRecord duplication the note
 * on the former describes: the two are the same object and the difference has
 * to be taken in one of them.
 *
 * It RETURNS the proc -- the declaration said `void`; see unknown-functions.h. */
