/* sub_080623C4 @ 0x080623C4, 176 bytes, THUMB.  MATCHED (wave 48, W48-D).
 *
 * Walks the {u8 x; u8 y; s16 v;} list at gUnknown_03003F20 -- the same 4-byte
 * view of that buffer src/decomp/c_0804151C.c builds and terminates with a
 * 0xFFFF v -- and returns the entry with the smallest v whose map cell is
 * still empty, blanking every entry it rejects.
 *
 * Three things were load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. THE MAP ADDRESSING IS THE c_0804151C.c IDIOM, one local per step:
 *      p = gMapData; t = y * 2; rows = p + 0x417a;
 *      off = *(u16 *)(rows + t) + x; cells = p + 0x3262;
 *    That is what keeps 0x417A and 0x3262 in pool words and emits
 *    `(map + K) + idx` rather than folding K into a load displacement.  The
 *    plane here is +0x3262, not c_0804151C.c's +0x12.
 *
 * 2. `bestV` IS `s16`, NOT `int` AND NOT A CAST.  agbcc's PROMOTE_MODE keeps a
 *    sub-word local ZERO-extended in its register, so `bestV = q->v` on an s16
 *    member is a plain `ldrh` (only the low half is live) while every READ of
 *    bestV in int context is `lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10`.  Spelling it `int` with
 *    (s16) casts produces the same instructions here but is not what the
 *    original wrote; spelling it `int` WITHOUT casts loses the shift pairs.
 *
 * 3. THE TAIL NEEDS THE EXPLICIT `else`.  `if (v != 0x7fff) { body; return 1; }
 *    return 0;` and `if (v == 0x7fff) return 0; body; return 1;` BOTH put the
 *    short 0-arm inline and the body at the far label -- the ROM has it the
 *    other way round.  Only `if (v == 0x7fff) return 0; else { body; return 1; }`
 *    emits `beq` to a trailing `movs r0,#0` with the body falling through and
 *    the second 0x7FFF pool word between them.  Measured, not guessed. */
