/* An on-screen test for a box of size (w, h) at (x, y): the camera origin
 * lives at +0x04 / +0x06 of the map descriptor gMapData points at,
 * and the box is accepted when it overlaps the 0xF0 x 0xA0 screen.
 *
 * `cmn r1, r3` is the tell for the lower bounds: the comparison is against
 * MINUS the size, `dy > -h`, which agbcc folds into a compare-negative.
 * Writing it as `dy + h > 0` materialises the sum with an `adds` and costs 4
 * bytes.
 *
 * The first parameter arrives u16 (`lsls #0x10; lsrs #0x10`) and is cast back
 * to s16 at its single use (`lsls #0x10; asrs #0x10`); the second arrives
 * already s16. Both entry shift pairs are the declarations; only the one at
 * the use is a cast in the source.
 *
 * RETURN RETYPED FROM `int` TO `u8` in wave 38 (W38-F). The body cannot tell
 * the difference -- it returns the literals 1 and 0 -- but its only caller
 * sub_08039188 re-narrows the result with `lsls r0,#0x18` before testing it,
 * which is agbcc re-narrowing a u8-returning callee and is exactly what an
 * `int` return does not produce. */
