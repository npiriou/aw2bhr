/* Five byte fields cleared or seeded, then a fixed five-call rebuild.
 *
 * The global pointer is re-loaded before every single store: each `strb`
 * through it may alias the pointer itself, so agbcc cannot keep it live. That
 * reload is in the ROM and is what five plain statements produce -- binding it
 * to a local first would remove all four extra `ldr`s.
 *
 * Every field needs `adds r0, #0xNN` rather than a displacement; strb's imm5
 * stops at 31 and all five offsets are past it. */
