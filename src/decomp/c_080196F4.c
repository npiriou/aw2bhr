/* Apply a 0xFF-terminated table of 12-byte unit-spawn commands: 0xFE resets
 * gCurrentArmyIndex (and the 0x40-scaled shadow gUnknown_03003F2C) to the
 * command's byte 1, anything else builds a unit through sub_08025C5C and
 * stamps the command's bytes into it, clamped against that unit type's caps in
 * gUnitTypeData. The entry value of gCurrentArmyIndex is saved in sl and
 * restored on the way out, so the whole table runs "as" whichever army each
 * 0xFE selects.
 *
 * The `if (u == NULL)` exit is a BREAK, not a return: the ROM branches to the
 * same block the loop guard does, and that block still runs sub_080258CC and
 * the restore.
 *
 * gCurrentArmyIndex and gUnknown_03003F2C each get an agbcc `-fforce-addr`
 * `.rodata` word (the ROM's 0x0808E5AC and 0x0808E5B0), parked in r8/sb and
 * re-loaded from memory at every use -- five and four references respectively.
 * gUnitTypeData, by contrast, is CSEd to a single reference and gets an
 * ordinary inline pool word, which is why there is no local for the table
 * element: writing `t = &gUnitTypeData[u->unk00];` as its own statement
 * computes the element address BEFORE `u->unk06_0`, and the ROM computes the
 * bitfield extract first.
 *
 * THE `do { } while (0)` IS LOAD-BEARING -- it is worth 7 bytes and it is the
 * wave-17 zero-trip-block register lever, found by decomp-permuter after four
 * hand spellings failed. Without it the `movs r0, #0` feeding the unk09/unk0a
 * stores is allocated r1 instead of r0 and lands one slot early, between
 * `ldrb r0,[r5,#3]` and its `strb r0,[r4,#1]`; the extra block boundary forces
 * the constant to reuse the register the unk01 store just freed. Neither
 * spelling from the "where a shared constant's register is CREATED" rule in
 * docs/agbcc-codegen.md moved it (`u->unk0a = u->unk09 = 0;` and a
 * `u->unk09 = v = 0;` local were both probed and both came out unchanged), so
 * that rule does not cover a constant shared by two ADJACENT byte stores. */
