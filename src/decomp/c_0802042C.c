/* Promoted from assembly; each function below is byte-for-byte

/* Traces a path downhill through the gUnknown_03003340 cost overlay from (x, y),
 * appending one direction code per step to *p and handing the run to
 * sub_08020634 to reverse in place. Each step samples the four orthogonal
 * neighbours (0 = +x, 1 = -x, 2 = -y, 3 = +y; off-map reads as 0xff), takes the
 * minimum, collects every neighbour tied for it, and breaks the tie with
 * sub_080129E0. `dir` survives across steps because the switch has no default
 * arm -- a tie count of 0 leaves the previous direction standing.
 *
 * The neighbour stores and the step switch are both written 0, 1, 3, 2; that is
 * the block order in the ROM for both, so it is source order and not a
 * scheduling artefact.
 *
 * The loop test goes through the `s8` local `c`: the ROM reads the cell with
 * `ldrb` and then sign-extends with `lsls #0x18; asrs #0x18` before `cmp #0`,
 * and a written-out `(s8)cell != 0` cannot produce that -- fold strips a
 * same-width sign change out of an equality test. A signed-char LOCAL does:
 * PROMOTE_MODE parks it zero-extended, so every signed read of it re-extends.
 *
 * The four neighbour samples MUST be if/else and not `?:`, and this was worth
 * 28 bytes -- the whole residual. A ternary gives one merged store, so agbcc
 * keeps a single `&nb[0]` in a register and reaches every element with a
 * displacement; written as two statements each arm materialises `sp + 8 + 2k`
 * from scratch, which is what the ROM does. This is the store-address twin of
 * the "one local where the original had N" rule. */
