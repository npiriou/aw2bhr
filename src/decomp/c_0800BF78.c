/* Commits a tile edit at (x, y): stash the cell's current tile in
 * gUnknown_0200B0B0->unk20, repaint it, then re-run sub_0800C124 and then
 * sub_0800C22C over the cell and its four cardinal neighbours, and repaint
 * once more.  Returns 0 if sub_0800BC98 rejects the cell, 1 otherwise.  The
 * `bl sub_0800BC98` is reached with r0/r1 untouched from entry -- a
 * pass-through, not a nullary call.  The tile fetch is the promoted
 * `c_08001158.c` idiom unchanged (rows at +0x417A, tiles at +0xA22).
 *
 * `pp`, `q` and `s` are the -fforce-addr workaround and none of them is the
 * original source: `gMapData` spelled by name is byte-for-byte exact
 * here on the FIRST try, and only its pool word relocates against this unit's
 * own .rodata, which the .text-only split cannot place.  Naming the ROM's word
 * instead means reproducing by hand the CSE the original got for free, and the
 * three locals are a direct readout of where the ROM caches and where it does
 * not:
 *
 *  - `q` is the middle level bound at the top (sb).  It serves the tile fetch
 *    and the FIRST half's `if (y > 0)` inner read, which is the only read in
 *    the function that the original satisfied from the top's forced address.
 *  - `s` is the middle level rebound after each of the two `if (x > 0)` merges
 *    (r7 both times), and each binding then serves three reads across
 *    intervening calls.  `**pp` cannot do this: a const global reached through
 *    a local pointer is not RTX_UNCHANGING_P, so the outer load does not
 *    survive a `bl` -- the wave-13 finding that says to bind the middle level
 *    explicitly.
 *  - `**pp` is right, and a local is wrong, at exactly one site: the SECOND
 *    half's `if (y > 0)` inner read, where the ROM re-derives both levels.
 *
 *  - `b` is bound before `q` because the ROM loads gUnknown_0200B0B0's pool
 *    word first.  That is the LHS-expands-first rule, but it only reaches the
 *    top of the block if the destination is a local: with the RHS split into
 *    statements (which the c_08001158 idiom requires) the store's own
 *    `ldr rN, =sym` would otherwise be emitted last.
 *  - `pp = &gUnknown_0808D86C` sits after sub_0800EC20, not at the top, because
 *    that is where the ROM emits `mov r8, r4`; the pool word itself is loaded
 *    once, at the top, and r4 carries it across the three intervening calls. */
