 * INSIDE it is agbcc's balanced switch over three case values, not an if-chain,
 * and cases 1 and 2 share a block: case 1 falls through into case 2's
 * sub_0803B828(). Case 3 is a separate block calling the same function, so the
 * source lists it separately rather than folding it into case 2.
 *
 * The parameter is never read -- the body opens by loading gUnknown_03003FC0
 * straight over r0 -- so its width is settled entirely at the only call site,
 * sub_0802C118, which hands it the u16 global gCurrentArmyIndex with a bare
 * `ldrb`. A byte load out of a halfword global is what a u8 parameter costs;
 * an `int` parameter would have emitted `ldrh`. `pop {r0}; bx r0`, so void.
