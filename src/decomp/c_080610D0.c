 */

/* sub_080610D0 @ 0x080610D0, 168 bytes.
 *
 * The ONLY difference between this and the obvious spelling is where the
 * constant 0 shared by the two `strb`s is materialised, and it is worth one
 * callee-saved register: the ROM sets it with `movs r1, #0` AFTER the
 * sub_08025E08 call and pushes {r4, r5, lr}, while the plain version creates the
 * pseudo before the two intervening calls, so it has to live in r6 and the
 * function pushes {r4, r5, r6, lr}. Instruction count and size are identical
 * either way -- the 31 differing bytes are register numbers.
 *
 * Probed directly: with only ONE `= 0` store the constant is materialised after
 * the call and the push list is right, so it is the SECOND use that creates the
 * long-lived pseudo. Neither `unit->unk0a = unit->unk09;`, nor
 * `unit->unk0a = unit->unk09 = 0;`, nor a `u8 z = 0;` local, nor swapping the
 * two stores, nor making `pos` a union moves it back.
 *
 * The `do { } while (0)` around the sub_08061178 store is what does move it
 * (found by decomp-permuter): it ends the basic block before the
 * sub_080611D8 call, so the constant cannot be hoisted above it. It is
 * standing in for whatever the original had there -- a macro, most likely --
 * and it is byte-neutral apart from that one effect.
