/* Counts the deployed units of every army that IS masked out -- the inverse of
 * sub_08058254's army selection. Three differences from that exemplar, and
 * they are the whole function:
 *
 *  - The army-mask test is INVERTED (`cmp r1,#0; beq` where the exemplar has
 *    `bne`), so this counts the armies whose bit in
 *    gArmyRecords[gCurrentArmyIndex].unk2c is SET.
 *  - The unit predicate is `unk00 == 0` (`ldrb; cmp #0; beq`), not `<= 2`.
 *  - The gUnitTypeData[unk00].unk0b cap test is absent, which is why this
 *    function carries five pool words to the exemplar's six.
 *
 * Everything else is transcribed from c_08058254.c: the inner loop is
 * `for (j = i * 64; j < i * 64 + 64; j++)` (the ROM's always-false entry guard
 * `cmp r3, r4; bge` is the proof -- a constant-bounded loop has no guard),
 * unk2c is a plain u8 shifted by a variable rather than a bitfield, and the
 * `lsls #0x18; asrs #0x18` pair on the map read IS the `(s8)` cast.
 *
 * MATCHED first draft. */

/* Counts the units of the NOT-masked-out armies whose unk00 is 1 or 2. Same
 * skeleton as c_08058254.c; two differences, both in the predicate block:
 *
 *  - The unit test is a RANGE, `(u8)(unk00 - 1) > 1` -- the ROM's
 *    `subs #1; lsls #0x18; lsrs #0x18; cmp #1; bhi`. The u8 truncation of the
 *    DIFFERENCE plus an unsigned compare is how a two-value id range is
 *    spelled with one branch (same idiom as c_0805CC88.c's
 *    `(u8)(unk00 - 0x10) <= 1`); a plain int `unk00 - 1 > 1` would drop the
 *    shift pair.
 *  - The gUnknown_0857680F class test and the gUnitTypeData cap test are
 *    both absent -- four pool words to the exemplar's six.
 *
 * The army mask stays INLINE in the loop condition even though the ROM hoists
 * its whole address computation into the preheader: that hoist is gcc's own
 * LICM, not a source-level local. Binding it to a local before the loop is
 * observably different code -- it sinks the `movs r5, #0` loop init BELOW the
 * hoisted block and moves gUnitRecords's address into a callee-saved
 * register. The ROM's order (`movs r7,#0; movs r5,#0` and only then the mask
 * expression) is the tell that the for-init precedes the preheader.
