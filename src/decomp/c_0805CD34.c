 * what the original source said -- and it is every instruction and every
 * register of the original.  agbcc's -fforce-addr parks the two addresses in
 * this unit's own .rodata because both are live across the builder's loop; the
 * two words are the ROM's gUnknown_0816DA00 / gUnknown_0816DA04 and the build now
 * places them there (tools/split_rodata.py).  The `u8 **const` workaround that
 * this function was parked on for five waves is NOT used: it reached the right
 * instruction multiset but left the `adds r6, r3, #0` copy 4th in the loop
 * preheader where the ROM has it last, and no source spelling moved it.
