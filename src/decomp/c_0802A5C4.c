/* The long lsls/adds/rsbs chain is agbcc's exact division of a POINTER
 * DIFFERENCE by the 12-byte stride: multiply by inv(3) = 0xAAAAAAAB, then
 * `asr #2`. `asr #8` is that same division followed by `>> 6`, i.e.
 * `(p - gUnitRecords) >> 6` -- the army number, the 64-entries-per-army
 * grouping recorded on gUnitRecords. Write the pointer arithmetic; never
 * the shifts.
 *
 * gUnitRecords is named the same honest way in both halves. The bit-6
 * store gets a plain inline pool word (one reference) while the bit-7 half
 * gets agbcc's -fforce-addr `.rodata` word -- what the ROM prints as
 * `gUnknown_08090B84` -- because its address is referenced across a
 * control-flow merge. That is the wave-18 reference-count rule, not two
 * different globals, and one honest spelling produces both.
 *
 * `q` must be its own statement, and it is worth exactly one byte. Writing
 * the scan as `gUnitRecords[i].unk00 != 0 && &gUnitRecords[i] != p
 * && ...` is 203 of 204 bytes: the slot address then comes out
 * `adds r1, r0, r2` (index, base) where the ROM has `adds r1, r2, r0`
 * (base, index). Binding the address once puts the base pointer first, which
 * is what expand_expr does for a plain ARRAY_REF that is not already a CSE
 * of three sibling reads. */
