 *
 * NO POINTER IS BOUND. The unit element is named twice and CSE gives it one
 * address -- and that is the whole difference between this and a candidate that
 * is 96.6% right. `u = &gUnitRecords[i]` puts the table's DEREF after the
 * `* 12` (91.4%); adding `tbl = gUnitRecords;` to pull the deref forward
 * fixes the order but then the declared local takes r1 where the ROM wants r0,
 * because a declared local's quantity is created at expand_decl and sorts ahead
 * of the unnamed product. Two levers that each fix half. Naming the element
 * twice needs neither: the deref lands first AND stays unnamed.
 *
 * The column is assigned inside the offset expression -- see c_08060264.c for
 * why that spelling and not a statement of its own. Row/tile arithmetic is
 * c_08001158.c's idiom with the plane at +0x234A. */
